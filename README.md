This is my project, as close as possible to the Topjava internship. Created for a more detailed analysis of the studied technologies during the internship.

Lunch Restaurant Voting System.
The system has two roles: user and administrator. The user votes for the selected restaurant. The administrator can edit the list of restaurants and their menus.

Used technologies:
- maven
- servlet: tomcat
- logging: slf4j and logback
- database: postgres and hsqldb with work through jpa, jdbc, hibernate
- test: JUnit5
- spring: core, mvc, security
